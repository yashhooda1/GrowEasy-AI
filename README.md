# 1. Modular Design: Users can plug in their own datasets and customize the agent's decision-making logic.
# 2. Explainability Layer: Every recommendation includes a clear explanation of the reasoning, making it accessible to small business owners.
# 3 GitHub Integration: Deployable as a GitHub Action for automated consulting reports, with a web-based dashboard for interactivity.
